Protect WooCommerce login, registration and password reset form against spam using Google's No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA.

== Description ==

A simple plugin for adding the new No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA to WooCommerce login, registration and password reset form to protect against spam.

### Features
*   Option to activate CAPTCHA in WooCommerce login, registration and password reset form page.
*   Choose a theme for the CAPTCHA.
*   Auto-detects the user's language

**Note:** Multiple instance of reCAPTCHA can not appear in the same page i.e only a single reCAPTCHA can exist per web page.

in the login form.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why isn't CAPTCHA showing in both WooCommerce login and registration form? =

Multiple instance of reCAPTCHA can not appear in the same page i.e only a single reCAPTCHA can exist per web page. That's how reCAPTCHA was programmed.

If you activate the CAPTCHA in both login and registration form, in WooCommerce checkout and My Account page, the CAPTCHA will appear only
in the login form.

Any question? post it in the support forum.
